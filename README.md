# Wacky-Trees
Managing a large discount store poses its challenges. After several years in business, The fictional, Wacky Store, is currently grappling with a storage dilemma as customer data is gradually overwhelming their storage drives. Addressed this issue by developing an encoding algorithm capable of representing text as concise numerical values.
WackyLinkedNodes stores a reference to the root of a WackyTree.
WackyTreeNodes: If left and right are null, it is considered a leaf node. Only leaf nodes can have a val that is not \0. If left or right is non-null, the other must be non-null as well. One side cannot exist without the other.
